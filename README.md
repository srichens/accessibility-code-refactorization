# accessibility-code-refactorization
Week 1 bootcamp homework challenge. Refactor code so that existing webpage meets accessibility standards. 

Changes that were made:

1. Added a descriptive title in head and put links after title.
2. Replaced all div and span elements with semantic elements.
3. Added alt text to all images and icons.
4. Changed background image to a regular img element, though that may not be necessary for acessibility, since the background image isn't relaying any information.
5. In the navigation bar, when Search Engine Optimization was clicked, it didn't move to that section on the webage like the other two, so added the missing id in the section to make the link move to the corresponding section.
5. Changed the h2 tag to h4 in the footer so headers for each section are sequential to avoid any confusion.
6. Added comments to the html and CSS to explain what was done.
